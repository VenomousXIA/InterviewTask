# Api used: Apache POI

- Used to handle writing to xlsx file without causing problems for arabic text as normal printwriter caused conversions to symbols.
- All dependency files are attached with the project in the "dependency" folder.

# Assumptions

- Phone number was handled as an egyptian phone number for validation (handling method was not described in task description).
- Assumed all mail were gmail so the validation rules are actually what gmail requires it to be (obtained by trying to create a new account).
